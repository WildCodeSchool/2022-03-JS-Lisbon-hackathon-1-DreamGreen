            <h1>Environmental Benefits of Recycling Used Cooking Oil</h1>
            <p>
                The rendering industry removes <b> 4.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from re-entering the environment annually</b>, according to the North American Renderers Association. This is in part due to the trickle down effect of recycling used cooking oil so that it can be repurposed into biodiesel, and because <b>renewable diesel is a cleaner-burning fuel that has been proven to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85 percent.</b>
                The rendering industry also helps reduce the world's carbon footprint by diminishing our reliance on limited resources. The North American Renderer's association estimates that rendering plants in North America reduce carbon emissions by approximately 12 million cars per year. By partnering with a used cooking oil recycler, you can help significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from returning to the environment and lower the world's carbon footprint.
